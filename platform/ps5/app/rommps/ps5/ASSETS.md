# Assets

The assets the title ships, written from `ps5/assets.json` by
`ps5/tools/build-assets.py --notices`. Only assets with a clear licence are
shipped: in PS5_VulkanTemplate, the asset pack's other files (the `assets`
submodule) stay out, and the samples that use them get the replacements here.
